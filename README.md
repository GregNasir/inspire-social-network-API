## Description

The inspire social network API, is a backend application that allows users to create, read, update and delete data. User can create a profile with their email, add thoughts, and even add friends. MongoDB was used to store data, due to its speed and flexibility. Other tools used for this application were:

* Javascript 
* Express
* npm modules
* dotenv package
* Run tests using nmp jest
* Timely commits to GitHub repository to save work

This application provided me with the opporturnity to write APIs, that connected with MongoDB. This exposed me to the power and flexibilty this database system provides.
